# 🦖 Multiplayer Dino Game 🎮

Welcome to the multiplayer version of the classic Chrome Dino game! This project takes the fun of the single-player game and amplifies it by adding a multiplayer feature. The best part? It's serverless!



## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the game, simply visit the [Multiplayer Dino Game](https://agentsj.github.io/Multiplayer-Dino.github.io/) website.

## 🎮 How to Play

The Single Player game controls are simple:

- Press `SinglePlayer` button
- Press `Start/Reset` to start and reset. (i know shocking)
- Click the game area or space bar to jump

The multiplayer can be confusing as it is serverless and uses webRtc but follow the guide.
